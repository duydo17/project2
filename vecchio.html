      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The bridge spans the Arno at its narrowest point where it is believed
        that a bridge was first built in Roman times, when the via Cassia
        crossed the river at this point. The Roman piers were of stone, the
        superstructure of wood.[citation needed] The bridge first appears in a
        document of 996 and was destroyed by a flood in 1117 and reconstructed
        in stone. In 1218 the Ponte alla Carraia, a wooden structure, was
        established nearby which led to it being referred to as "Ponte Nuovo"
        relative to the older (Vecchio) structure. It was swept away again in
        1333 except for two of its central piers, as noted by Giovanni Villani
        in his Nuova Cronica. It was rebuilt in 1345. Giorgio Vasari recorded
        the traditional view of his day that attributed its design to Taddeo
        Gaddi— besides Giotto one of the few artistic names of the trecento
        still recalled two hundred years later. Modern historians present Neri
        di Fioravanti as a possible candidate as builder. Sheltered in a little
        loggia at the central opening of the bridge is a weathered dedication
        stone, which once read Nel trentatrè dopo il mille-trecento, il ponte
        cadde, per diluvio dell' acque: poi dieci anni, come al Comun piacque,
        rifatto fu con questo adornamento. The Torre dei Mannelli was built at
        the southeast corner of the bridge to defend it.

      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The bridge consists of three segmental arches: the main arch has a span
        of 30 meters (98 feet) the two side arches each span 27 meters (89
        feet). The rise of the arches is between 3.5 and 4.4 meters (11½ to 14½
        feet), and the span-to-rise ratio 5:1.[9] The shallow segmental arches,
        which require fewer piers than the semicircular arch traditionally used
        by Romans, enabled ease of access and navigation for animal-drawn carts.
        Another notable design element is the large piazza at the center of the
        bridge that Leon Battista Alberti described as a prominent ornament in
        the city. A stone with an inscription from Dante (Paradiso xvi. 140-7)
        records the spot at the entrance to the bridge where Buondelmonte de'
        Buondelmonti was murdered by the Amidei clan in 1215, which began the
        urban fighting of the Guelfs and Ghibellines. The bridge has always
        hosted shops and merchants who displayed their goods on tables before
        their premises, after authorization by the Bargello (a sort of a lord
        mayor, a magistrate and a police authority).
