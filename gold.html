      <h4 class="detail_text">1.History</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San
        Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of
        San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a
        regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of
        transporting water to San Francisco. The Sausalito Land and Ferry
        Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate
        Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry
        operation in the world by the late 1920s.Once for railroad passengers
        and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very
        profitable and important to the regional economy.The ferry crossing
        between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito Ferry
        Terminal in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00
        per vehicle,[when?] a price later reduced to compete with the new
        bridge.better source needed] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry
        Building took 27 minutes. Many wanted to build a bridge to connect San
        Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city
        still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a
        permanent link with communities around the bay, the city's growth rate
        was below the national average. Many experts said that a bridge could
        not be built across the 6,700-foot (2,000-metre) strait, which had
        strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372 ft (113 m) deep[17]
        at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said
        that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and
        operation.

      <h4 class="detail_text">2.Construction</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        Construction began on January 5, 1933.The project cost more than $35
        million ($550 million in 2021 dollars), and was completed ahead of
        schedule and $1.3 million under budget (equivalent to $25.7 million
        today).The Golden Gate Bridge construction project was carried out by
        the McClintic-Marshall Construction Co., a subsidiary of Bethlehem Steel
        Corporation founded by Howard H. McClintic and Charles D. Marshall, both
        of Lehigh University. An original rivet replaced during the seismic
        retrofit after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A total of 1.2 million
        steel rivets hold the bridge's two towers together. Strauss remained
        head of the project, overseeing day-to-day construction and making some
        groundbreaking contributions. A graduate of the University of
        Cincinnati, he placed a brick from his alma mater's demolished McMicken
        Hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured. Strauss also
        innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the men working,
        which saved many lives. Nineteen men saved by the nets over the course
        of the project formed the Half Way to Hell Club. Nonetheless eleven men
        were killed in falls, ten on February 17, 1937, when a scaffold with
        twelve men on it, and secured by undersized bolts, fell into and broke
        through the safety net; two of the twelve survived the 200-foot (61 m)
        fall into the water. The bridge opened May 27, 1937. The Bridge Round
        House diner was then included in the southeastern end of the Golden Gate
        Bridge, adjacent to the tourist plaza which was renovated in 2012. The
        Bridge Round House, an Art Deco design by Alfred Finnila completed in
        1938, has been popular throughout the years as a starting point for
        various commercial tours of the bridge and an unofficial gift shop. The
        diner was renovated in 2012 and the gift shop was then removed as a new,
        official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza. During the
        bridge work, the Assistant Civil Engineer of California Alfred Finnila
        had overseen the entire iron work of the bridge as well as half of the
        bridge's road work.
