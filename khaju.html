      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The Khaju Bridge was built around 1650, under the reign of Abbas II, the
        seventh Safavid king (shah) of Iran, on the foundations of an older
        bridge. The existing inscriptions suggest that the bridge was repaired
        in 1873. There is a pavilion located in the center of the structure,
        inside which Abbas II would have once sat, admiring the view. Today,
        remnants of a stone seat is all that is left of the king's chair. In
        words of Arthur Pope and Jean Chardin, Khaju is "the culminating
        monument of Persian bridge architecture and one of the most interesting
        bridges extant ... where the whole has rhythm and dignity and combines
        in the happiest consistency, utility, beauty, and recreation."The poets
        of Isfahan wrote beautiful poems on the Khajoo bridge and in these poems
        they praised its beauties. Among these poems is the long poem by Saeb
        Tabrizi which describes one of the days of celebration and illumination
        next to this bridge. According to historians and scholars who have
        studied the Safavid dynasty, Shah Abbas II's goal in building the Khajoo
        Bridge was to connect the two districts of Khajoo and the Hassanabad
        Gate with Takht-e Folad and Shiraz Road. Tourists who came to Isfahan at
        different times praised the beauty of the Khajoo Bridge and considered
        it one of the eternal masterpieces of Iranian and Islamic architecture.

      <h4 class="detail_text">2.Structure</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The bridge has 23 arches and is 133 meters long and 12 meters wide. It
        was originally decorated with tilework and paintings and served as a
        teahouse. The passway of the bridge is made of bricks and stones with 21
        larger and 26 smaller inlet and outlet channels and is 7.5 meters wide.
        The pieces of stone used in the bridge are over 2 meters long, and the
        distance between every channel and the ceiling base is 21 meters. There
        are several sluice gates under the archways, through which the water
        flow of the Zayanderud is regulated. When the sluice gates are closed,
        the water level behind the bridge is raised to facilitate the irrigation
        of the many gardens along the river upstream of the bridge. On the upper
        level of the bridge, the main central aisle was utilized by horses and
        carts and the vaulted paths on either side by pedestrians. Octagonal
        pavilions in the center of the bridge on both the down and the upstream
        sides provide vantage points for the remarkable views. The lower level
        of the bridge may be accessed by pedestrians and remains a popular shady
        place for relaxing. Iranian architects have raised concerns about damage
        inflicted on the bridge during recent "improvement program" renovations,
        citing, among other problems, the destruction of the original stepped
        base of the bridge, the alterations made to the riverbed, and the
        removal of the Safavid inscribed stone blocks from the bridge.
