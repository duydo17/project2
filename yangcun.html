        <p class="detail_text-p">
          The Yangcun Bridge is a railway bridge located in China. It is 35.812
          kilometres long, or roughly 117,500 feet, making it one of the 10
          longest bridges in China, ranging from the 7thâ€“9th longest according
          to different sources.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 class="detail_text">2.Construction</h4>
        <p class="detail_text-p">
          One major challenge faced by the project was the eruption of natural
          gas in a shallow layer along the bridge line. A special study was
          conducted and exploration was performed to investigate the
          distribution of the gas and the property of the soil during and after
          releasing the gas. The gas was released before pile driving to avoid
          any disturbance to the soil, collapsing of ground or eruption and
          flaming of gas. Mostly, construction activity was performed on land
          and then the prefabricated components were transported to the site for
          erection and final installation. For shipping and erecting the girders
          in sea, giant floating cranes with accurate anchoring devices and
          launching gantries were used. Construction on mudflats near the south
          shore, in an alternating wet and dry tidal area, presented serious
          technical problems. A temporary 10km trestle was erected for pile
          driving and pier construction. Girders weighing 1,430t were erected
          from the top, starting from the land end and launching towards the
          sea. Each previously erected span served as the deck for
          transportation and erection of the next girders as the launching
          gantry moved forward. Also, severe marine conditions caused
          difficulties in anchoring barges and construction vessels. Under
          turbulent tidal flow and typhoon influences, water flow currents were
          in the range of 2m/s to 3.32m/s at the Hangzhou Bay Bridge sites. The
          floating cranes could safely transport the 2,000t girder from the
          shore to the site and then anchor stably to erect and install the
          precast concrete box girder.
