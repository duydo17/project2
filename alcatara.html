      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The Alcántara Bridge has suffered more damage from war than from the
        elements over the years. The Moors destroyed one of the smallest arches
        in 1214 although this was rebuilt centuries later, in 1543, with stone
        taken from the original quarries. The second arch on the northwest side
        was then later destroyed in 1760 by the Spanish to stop the Portuguese
        advancing and was repaired in 1762 by Charles III, only to be blown up
        again in 1809 by Wellington's forces attempting to stop the French.
        Temporary repairs were made in 1819, but much of the bridge was
        destroyed yet again in 1836 by the Carlists. The bridge was rebuilt in
        1860 using mortared masonry. And following completion of the José María
        de Oriol Dam, which allowed for the draining of the Tagus riverbed, the
        main pillars were completely repaired in 1969. The bridge originally
        measured 190 m (620 ft) in length, which today is reduced to 181.7 m
        (596 ft).The clear spans of the six arches from the right to the left
        riverside are 13.6 m (45 ft), 23.4 m (77 ft), 28.8 m (94 ft), 27.4 m (90
        ft), 21.9 m (72 ft) and 13.8 m (45 ft).

      <h4 class="detail_text">2.Construction</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        The bridge's construction occurred in the ancient Roman province of
        Lusitania. In Ancient Rome, the costs of building and repairing bridges,
        known as opus pontis ("bridge work"), were the responsibility of
        multiple local municipalities. Their shared costs prove Roman bridges
        belonged to the region overall, and not to any one town (or two, if on a
        border). The Alcántara Bridge was built at the expense of 12 local
        municipalities in Lusitania. The names were added on an inscription on
        the archway over the central pier.
