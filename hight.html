        The Millau Viaduct is a cable-stayed viaduct that spans the valley of
        the River Tarn in Millau, Aveyron province, southern France. The bridge
        was designed by British architect Norman Foster and French bridge
        engineer Michel Virlogeux. This bridge was once considered the tallest
        in the world and is still the tallest bridge in the world today.

        The tallest bridge in China. Located in Guizhou Province, the rope
        bridge spans a large gorge and is an important part of the
        Pingtang-Ladian highway. The main tower of the building is the tallest
        concrete column in the world. The local government has spent about
        US$215 million to build a project to encourage travel time reduction
        between Pingtang (Guizhou) and Luodian (Shanghai). The bridge will open
        in 2020, and visitors can drive across these two points in about an
        hour. Before the tree is erected, the trip alternates for 2 hours.<a
