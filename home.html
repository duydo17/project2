              The bridge is located between Shanghai and Nanjing in eastern
              China's Jiangsu province. It includes a 9 km (5.6 mi) stretch of
              water across Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou. The bridge was completed in
              2010 and opened in 2011. During construction, 10,000 people were
              employed, construction took four years and cost about $8.5
              billion. <a href="#!dany">[see more...]</a>

              According to Dio Cassius, the bridge was built in 62 BC, the year
              after Cicero was consul, to replace an earlier wooden bridge
              destroyed by fire. It was commissioned by Lucius Fabricius, the
              curator of the roads and a member of the gens Fabricia of Rome.
              Completely intact from Roman antiquity, it has been in continuous
              use ever since. <a href="#!pons">[see more...]</a>

            <p>
              Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route
              between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat
              across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as
              early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the
              1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco. The
              Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867,
              eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern
              Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the
              world by the late 1920s.Once for railroad passengers and customers
              only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable
              and important to the regional economy.The ferry crossing between
              the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito Ferry Terminal
              in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00 per
              vehicle,[when?] a price later reduced to compete with the new
              bridge.[better source needed] The trip from the San Francisco
              Ferry Building took 27 minutes. <br> <a href="#!gold">[see more...]</a>
