        Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San
        Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of
        San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a
        regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of
        transporting water to San Francisco. The Sausalito Land and Ferry
        Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate
        Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry
        operation in the world by the late 1920s.Once for railroad passengers
        and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very
        profitable and important to the regional economy.The ferry crossing
        between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito Ferry
        Terminal in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00
        per vehicle,[when?] a price later reduced to compete with the new
        bridge.[better source needed] The trip from the San Francisco Ferry
        Building took 27 minutes. <a href="#!gold">[see more...]</a>

        The Ponte Vecchio ("Old Bridge", Italian pronunciation: [ˈponte
        ˈvɛkkjo]) is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over
        the Arno River, in Florence, Italy. The only bridge in Florence spared
        from destruction during the Second World War, it is noted for the shops
        built along it; building shops on such bridges was once a common
        practice. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops;
        the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers. The
        Ponte Vecchio's two neighboring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and
        the Ponte alle Grazie. <a href="#!vecchio">[see more...]</a>

        The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel through arch bridge in Sydney,
        spanning Sydney Harbour from the central business district (CBD) to the
        North Shore. The view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby Sydney
        Opera House is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of
        Australia itself. Nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based
        design, the bridge carries rail, vehicular , bicycle and pedestrian
        traffic.<a href="#!sydney">[see more...]</a>
