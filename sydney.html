      <h4 class="detail_text">1.History</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        There had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1814, when convict
        and noted architect Francis Greenway reputedly proposed to Governor
        Lachlan Macquarie that a bridge be built from the northern to the
        southern shore of the harbour. In 1825, Greenway wrote a letter to the
        then "The Australian" newspaper stating that such a bridge would "give
        an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory
        on the colony and the Mother Country". Nothing came of Greenway's
        suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions
        were made during the nineteenth century. In 1840, naval architect Robert
        Brindley proposed that a floating bridge be built. Engineer Peter
        Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across
        the harbour around 1857. A suggestion for a truss bridge was made in
        1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at £850,000 was
        proposed. In 1900, the Lyne government committed to building a new
        Central railway station and organised a worldwide competition for the
        design and construction of a harbour bridge, overseen by Minister for
        Public Works Edward William O'Sullivan. Local engineer Norman Selfe
        submitted a design for a suspension bridge and won the second prize of
        £500. In 1902, when the outcome of the first competition became mired in
        controversy, Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for
        a steel cantilever bridge. The selection board were unanimous,
        commenting that, "The structural lines are correct and in true
        proportion, and... the outline is graceful".However due to an economic
        downturn and a change of government at the 1904 NSW State election
        construction never began.[citation needed] Sydney Harbour Bridge design
        proposed by Ernest Stowe Three-span bridge linking Millers Point with
        Balls Head and Balmain, proposed by Ernest Stowe in 1922 A unique
        three-span bridge was proposed in 1922 by Ernest Stowe with connections
        at Balls Head, Millers Point, and Balmain with a memorial tower and hub
        on Goat Island.

      <h4 class="detail_text">2.Construction</h4>
      <p class="detail_text-p">
        Bradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it
        took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally
        championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched
        general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to
        the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the
        Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield
        subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's
        design. This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that
        instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a
        document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not
        constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction
        ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very
        tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge to makes
        things clear. The official ceremony to mark the turning of the first sod
        occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point where two
        workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed. An
        estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and
        commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed,
        with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself
        commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by
        September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in
        place on each side of the harbour. As construction of the approaches
        took place, work was also started on preparing the foundations required
        to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and
        granite faced abutment towers were constructed, with the angled
        foundations built into their sides. Once work had progressed
        sufficiently on the support structures, a giant creeper crane was
        erected on each side of the harbour.These cranes were fitted with a
        cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow
        for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the
        arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with steel cables passed
        through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to
        stop them collapsing as they extended outwards. Arch construction itself
        began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on
        ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with
        alignment. The cranes would "creep" along the arches as they were
        constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two
        years, on 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the
        first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch
        together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support
        cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was
        celebrated by flying the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom from
        the jibs of the creeper cranes. Once the arch was completed, the creeper
        cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and
        other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The
        vertical hangers were attached to the arch, and these were then joined
        with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were
        built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by
        June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled. Rails for trains and
        trams were laid, and road was surfaced using concrete topped with
        asphalt. Power and telephone lines, and water, gas, and drainage pipes
        were also all added to the bridge in 1931.[citation needed] The pylons
        were built atop the abutment towers, with construction advancing rapidly
        from July 1931. Carpenters built wooden scaffolding, with concreters and
        masons then setting the masonry and pouring the concrete behind it.
        Gangers built the steelwork in the towers, while day labourers manually
        cleaned the granite with wire brushes. The last stone of the north-west
        pylon was set in place on 15 January 1932, and the timber towers used to
        support the cranes were removed. On 19 January 1932, the first test
        train, a steam locomotive, safely crossed the bridge. Load testing of
        the bridge took place in February 1932, with the four rail tracks being
        loaded with as many as 96 New South Wales Government Railways steam
        locomotives positioned end-to-end. The bridge underwent testing for
        three weeks, after which it was declared safe and ready to be opened.
        The construction worksheds were demolished after the bridge was
        completed, and the land that they were on is now occupied by Luna Park.
        The standards of industrial safety during construction were poor by
        today's standards. Sixteen workers died during construction,but
        surprisingly only two from falling off the bridge. Several more were
        injured from unsafe working practices undertaken whilst heating and
        inserting its rivets, and the deafness experienced by m
